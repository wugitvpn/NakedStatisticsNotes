# Chapter 1: Introduction

**Description and Comparison:**

Statistics rarely offers a "right" way of doing something but provides meaningful information in an easily accessible way. A good example is the quarterback passer rating, which collapses  complex information into a single number and is a nice tool for making a quick comparison between the performances of the quarterbacks on a given day and simplify things. That is both the strength and the weakness of any descriptive statistic because the number will not tell whether a quarterback had a bad break. However, it certainly gives us some valuable information in a convenient format. Another example is the GPAs, which is a handy tool for accessing students' academic potential and is easy to understand and compare across students.  But it is not perfect because it does not reflect the difficulty of the courses  that different students may have taken. Thus, an overreliance on any descriptive statistic can lead to misleading conclusion or cause undesirable behavior.

**Inference:**

To check the number if homeless people live on the streets of Chicago, it is expensive and logistically difficult to count the homeless population in a large metropolitan area. Yet it is important to have a numerical estimate of this population for providing social services, earning eligibility for state and federal revenues, and gaining congressional representation. So that we use sampling to gather data in a small area. Another example is the political polls, which the research organization will attempt to contact a sample of households that are broadly representative of the larger population and ask them their vires about a particular issue or candidate.

**Accessing Risk and Other Probability-Related Events:**

Many businesses must access risks associated with assorted adverse outcomes and they cannot make those risks go away. Any business facing uncertainty can manage these risks by engineering processes so that the probability of an adverse outcome, anything from an environmental catastrophe  to a defective product, becomes acceptably low. when individuals and firms cannot make unacceptable risks go away, they seek protection in other ways. The entire insurance industry is built upon charging customers to protect them against some adverse outcome, such as a car crash or a house fire.

Probability is one weapon in an arsenal that requires good judgement. However, there are limitations of using probability because a large group of test takers might have the same wrong answers by coincidence.

**Identifying Important Relationships:**

If we observe a marked difference in some outcome between the two groups while holding constant the effects of other important variables, we can safely infer that the variable of interest is what caused that outcome. Then we use regression analysis to do two crucial things. 1). Quantify the association observed between the two groups. 2). Quantify the likelihood that the association  between the cause and consequence observed in this study is merely a coincidence. However, we can isolate a strong association between two variables by using statistical analysis, but we cannot necessarily  explain why that relationship exists, and in some cases, we cannot know for certain that the relationship is casual, meaning that a change in one variable is really causing a change in the other.

**Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics:**

Statistical analysis rarely unveils "the truth." There are numerous reasons that intellectually honest individuals may disagree about statistical results or their implications. An example is people argue for the best basketball player because there is no objective definition of "best." In reality, we can lie with statistics or make inadvertent errors. In either case, the mathematical precision attached to statistical analysis can dress up to some serious nonsense.
